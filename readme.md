### 2. **Exhibition Version: AR-Enhanced Material Cubes**

For exhibitions, this variation introduces small, tactile cubes made from different materials (e.g., woods, metals, textiles) that have QR codes or NFC tags embedded. Visitors scan the cubes with their smartphones to reveal an AR visualization of furniture or textiles and detailed information about their origin and sustainable properties.

**How It Works**:

- **Interactive Scanning**: Visitors pick up a cube, scan the QR code or tap the NFC tag, and instantly see a piece of furniture or a design element in AR.
- **Educational Insight**: Each scan presents information about the item, its craftsmanship, and the sustainability story behind it. The integration of touchable materials with AR visualization deepens the sensory experience and connection to the content.

**Marketing Appeal**:

- **Immersive and Educational**: Promote this experience as a bridge between physical interaction and digital storytelling that engages audiences with heritage-rich Flemish design.
- **Captivating and Shareable**: Encourage social sharing by adding a feature for visitors to take photos of the AR experience and share their interactions on social media.
- **Versatile Setup**: Highlight the portability and adaptability of these cubes for different exhibition spaces, making it an attractive, interactive feature for event planners.
