# AR-Enhanced Material Cubes for Exhibitions

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor thesis**, showcasing innovative solutions for interactive education using AR technologies.

In collaboration with [Trendwolves], a marketing agency specializing in youth culture, and [Fedustria], the Belgian federation of the textile, wood, and furniture industries, we created an AR experience for [Twiinz.world], a platform that introduces students to the world of Flemish materials and craftsmanship.

The **AR-Enhanced Material Cubes** offer an innovative and tactile way for visitors to explore Flemish craftsmanship at exhibitions. This interactive experience bridges physical and digital storytelling, allowing users to engage with sustainable materials and designs through augmented reality. By combining touchable cubes with AR visualizations, this setup creates a memorable, immersive, and educational exhibit.

## How It Works

1. **Pick a Cube**  
   Visitors select a tactile cube crafted from wood, metal, textile, or other materials.

2. **Scan the Cube**  
   Using a smartphone, visitors either scan the QR code or tap the embedded NFC tag to access the AR visualization.

3. **Explore the AR Content**  
   An interactive 3D model of a furniture piece or textile appears in AR, accompanied by educational details about its design, origin, and sustainable properties.

4. **Capture and Share**  
   Visitors can take photos of the AR visualization and share their experience online.
